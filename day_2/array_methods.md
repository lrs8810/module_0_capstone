## Array Methods

1. The `.sort` method results in a new array where the elements are sorted. If the array elements are strings then they are sorted alphabetically. If the elements are numbers then they are sorted in ascending value order.

1. The `.join` method mashes the array into one string without any space characters.

1. The `.index` method returns the index of an element if the argument or block object is the same as one of the elements, otherwise it will return `nil`.

1. The `.include?` method returns `true` if the given object is present in the array otherwise it will return `false`.

1. The `.each` method iterates over each of the elements using the block and returns the original array.

1. The `.collect` method iterates over each of the elements using the block to produce a new array.

1. The `.first` method returns the first element of the array.

1. The `.last` method returns the last element of the array.

1. The `.shuffle` method returns a new array with elements of the original array shuffled.
